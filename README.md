# 14-MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
This project was done to show the Model-View-Controller paridigm where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts too. I wanted to create this to have a more centralized location where developers could go. While creating this application, I learned that there are MANY moving parts that need to be connected in order for everything to work as intended. 

## Installation
NA

## Usage
When you are presented with the homepage, you are able to see blogs posted by other users. In order to add your own posts or make comments, you will need to create an account. Sign up with a username and password. You will have your own dashboard that shows your blog posts.
